# Ontology

## Overview of Saskantinon Ontology

Rather than an entity-relationship diagram, the underlying data structures and concepts for the Saskan Game and its architecture are defined in a formal ontology. The intention is to work out a set of definitions, concepts, and meanings that might be appropriate for any game world of this type. The ontology is a work in progress, and is not yet complete.
 Ideally one or more schemas generated from the ontology will be used to define the data structures and relationships in the data namespaces.

This type of tool may also be used to manage terms, languages, places and other descriptive aspects of the world, that is, not only its technical structures and relationships. 

This is pretty much an experiment in trying to develop a thorough logical and ontological underpinning for the world that can be used as a reference for any development, either in terms of software or in terms of story telling. Remains to be seen if this approach will be fruitful.


## Tools and Technology

The Protégé ontology editor is used to create and edit the ontology. For more information on this tool, see: [protege.stanford.ed](https://protege.stanford.ed) The Saskan ontology is stored in the OWL format, using RDF standards. It is persisted in the application's "schema" namespace.

Local copy of the ontology is stored in the project directory and in the application directory under the "schema" directory. The file name is "saskan\_ontology\_xml.owl". When opened using the tool, it directs to the URI: [www.semanticweb.org/genuinemerit/ontologies/2021/10/saskan\_ontology](http://www.semanticweb.org/genuinemerit/ontologies/2021/10/saskan_ontology)
