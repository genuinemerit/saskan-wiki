# Application Ontology
Overview
Rather than an entity-relationship diagram, the underlying data structures and concepts for the Saskan Game World and its architecture are defined in a formal ontology. The intention is to work out a set of definitions, concepts, and meanings that might be appropriate for any game world of this type. The ontology is a work in progress, and is not yet complete.
 Ideally one or more schemas generated from the ontology will be used to define the data structures and relationships in the data namespaces.

 Tools and Technology
The Protégé ontology editor is used to create and edit the ontology. For more information on this tool, see: [protege.stanford.ed](https://protege.stanford.ed) The Saskan ontology is stored in the OWL format, using RDF standards. It is persisted in the application's "schema" namespace.
 Local copy of the ontology is stored in the project directory and in the application directory under the "schema" directory. The file name is "saskan\_ontology\_xml.owl". When opened using the tool, it directs to the URI: [www.semanticweb.org/genuinemerit/ontologies/2021/10/saskan\_ontology](http://www.semanticweb.org/genuinemerit/ontologies/2021/10/saskan_ontology)
