        <p>Name:value pairs with unique names is the fundamental design principle.</p>
        <p>The system is not (yet) using Redis or Sqllite or Postrgres. It is using a simple JSON file for each data record, organized into namespaces defined as Linux directories.</p>
        <p>Standard key structure is as follows, with each part of the key separated by a colon. Key content should not therefore use the colon character, expect as a part separator. Use of punctuation in the key content is discouraged.
            <ul>
                <li>Descriptive key part, minimally including a record type identifier with a version number. May have multiple parts, which are separated by a tilde (~).
                <li>Create timestamp, in the format YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.SSS. All dates and times are assumed to be UTC. There is no need to specify a time zone.
                <li>Expiration timestamp, in the format YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.SSS.
                <li>Unique identifier, a cryptographically strong hash.
            </ul>
        <p>Persisted data should be compressed and cast to base64 encoding. This is to reduce the size of the data files, and to avoid problems with special characters in the data.
        <p>There are no plans at present to encrypt the data at rest, though that's not a bad idea. For senstive PPI data, it is a must. Such data should also be stored on a separate Linux server altogether.
