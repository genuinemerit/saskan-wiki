        <p>Most stored textual and numerical data is organized as JSON data.
        <p>Message formats are defined using a more explicit JSON schema. See <a href="./svc_structure.html">Service Message Structures</a> for more detail.
        <p>In some cases, data are managed in an ODF spreadsheet, then loaded to pandas dataframes, transformed into graph data, and then stored as pickled networkx objects.
        <p>Image data are stored as binary files using PNG, JPG and other standard image formats.
        <p>Sound effect files will likely be WAV or OGG formats.
        <p>Music files will likely be stored as MIDI, though some may be "compiled" into WAV or OGG.
        <P>Animation effects will be handled by PyGame. Not sure yet if OpenGL will be used. No plans at this point to serve up video files.
