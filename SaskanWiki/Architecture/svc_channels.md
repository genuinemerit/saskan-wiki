# Service Channels

A Channel is associated with a topic or sub-topic and implements a specific instance of a type of message broker. A channel's topic is subscribed to by a set of peers (clients). Traffic on the channel is managed by a Controller component.

 See the [Service Brokers](Brokers) page for an overview of what are the types of brokers.
