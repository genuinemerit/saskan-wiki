        <h2>Overview</h3>
        <p>Good intentions:
        <ul>
            <li>Game play is driven by the player's choices and by choices made by non-player characters.
            <li>Players are free to run multiple characters.
            <li>The player's choices are driven/implemented by the player's character. If the player delays too long in making choices, the character-event software will make them for the player.
            <li>Play levels, options, are configurable.
            <li>A world is generated by the event-handling software, based on the ontology and the game data. It contains a large variety of settings, characters, and events. There is both a meta-narrative and many sub-narratives. The world has a timeline, and events are scheduled on the timeline.
            <li>Player characters are created and may perish within the timeline. There is a reincarnation aspect to the game in which "karma" passes from one character to another.  The player's character is a "soul" that is reincarnated into a new body.  Very advanced characters may be reborn into "higher realms". Very bad characters may be rebon into "lower realms". These realms are part of the game play, tied mainly into what types of characters the player can play and in what part of the world they are incarnated.
            <li>Players navigate the world using maps depicting the world at various levels of detail, similar in some ways to how "Civilization" works, but including more detailed "zoom-in's".
            <li>Game play is driven by narratives generated by the event-management software. The outcomes as the narrative proceeds is modified by the player choices.
            <li>There is a musical component to the game play. Music is generated by the event-management software, and is based on the ontology and the game data. The music is generated in real time, and is based on the current state of the game world. The music is also based on the player's choices and movements. It is a key part of the rewards/feedback element of the game.
            <li>The narrative is tied to the storyline expressed in the accompanying novel.

        </ul>
