        <h2>Overview</h3>
        <p>Along with its message-based services layer, the Saskan software ecosystem also uses several types of more traditional software components.

        <h2>Functional Components</h3>

        <p>Python classes providing generic functions used by many other classes are referred to as <strong>functional components</strong>. These include:
        <ul>
            <li>File IO, including metadata management, pickling and persistence
            <li>Record IO, for handling construction of specific data record types
            <li>Message IO, for handling construction and sequencing of specific message payloads
            <li>Shell IO, providing calls to operating system functions
            <li>Music IO, handling MIDI and audio file construction and playback, including manufacturing of scores
            <li>Time IO, providing time and date functions set in the game world
            <li>Wiretap IO, managing logging and monitoring functions
            <li>Graphs IO, for manipulating and displaying graph data, including maps
            <li>Reports IO, for generating and displaying reports
            </ul>
        <p>Software <strong>components</strong> (python classes) providing those features expose methods callable by other compoments.


        <h2>Procedural and Event-Driven (GUI) Components</h3>

        <p><strong>Procedural components</strong> (python classes with a "__main__" hook) are like a script that executes a particular task one time. The main procedural component is <strong>saskan_install.py</strong>, which installs the software under the user's home account on Linux and in the /dev/shm memory space. It is run from the command line, via a bash script, requires sudo-level privileges, and communicates directly to the console.
        <p><strong>Event-Driven components</strong> (python classes with a "__main__" hook and a pygame event loop) use the PyGame library to provide a GUI. The main event-driven component at present is <strong>saskan_eyes.py</strong>, which provides a GUI for the admin application components. It is launched from the command line, via a bash script. The intention is to provide one or more additional GUI compoonents, tentatively, <strong>saskan.py</strong> for the game itself.
