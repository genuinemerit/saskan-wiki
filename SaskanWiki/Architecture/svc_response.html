        <p>See the <a href="./svc_request.html">Message Request</a> section for a contextualization of the message response process flow.
        <p>There are likely to be many "_reponse.py" modules, but they all have functions in common:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Message Expiration</strong>>. The lifetime of a message is typically limited to a few seconds, though some might need a longer lifespan. The message expiration is set by the gateway according to the metadata defining the message and its context. There is a "sweeper" process that continually checks for expired message in the Harvest namespace and archives or deletes them.
                <li><strong>Harvest IO</strong>. Write message content to the shared memory namespace per format defined by metadata.
                <li><strong>Broker IO</strong>. Return the key to the Harvest record to the message broker. (Not sure yet what this communication process consists of...async call I think.) This is also the point at which a message may be routed to an Invalid Message broker rather than its originally-intended channel.
            </ul>
