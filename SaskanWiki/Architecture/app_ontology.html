        <h2>Overview</h3>
        <p>Rather than an entity-relationship diagram, the underlying data structures and concepts for the Saskan Game World and its architecture are defined in a formal ontology. The intention is to work out a set of definitions, concepts, and meanings that might be appropriate for any game world of this type. The ontology is a work in progress, and is not yet complete.
        <p>Ideally one or more schemas generated from the ontology will be used to define the data structures and relationships in the data namespaces.

        <h2>Tools and Technology</h3>
        <p>The Protégé ontology editor is used to create and edit the ontology. For more information on this tool, see: <a href="https://protege.stanford.ed">protege.stanford.ed</a>  The Saskan ontology is stored in the OWL format, using RDF standards.  It is persisted in the application's "schema" namespace.
        <p>Local copy of the ontology is stored in the project directory and in the application directory under the "schema" directory. The file name is "saskan_ontology_xml.owl".  When opened using the tool, it directs to the URI: <a href="http://www.semanticweb.org/genuinemerit/ontologies/2021/10/saskan_ontology">www.semanticweb.org/genuinemerit/ontologies/2021/10/saskan_ontology</a>
