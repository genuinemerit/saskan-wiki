# Services Architecture

See the application architecture page for an overview of what a [service-oriented application architecture](Services) does.

The message-based services rely primarily on the Python Asyncio library. They are designed to be modular and extensible.

Main categories of software components that manage the services:
 * [Metadata](Metadata
 * [Servers, Controllers](Controllers)
 * [Topics](Topics)
 * [Channels](Channels)
 * [Brokers](Brokers)
 * [Message Payloads](Payload)
 * [Message Structure](Message_Structures)
 * [Clients](Clients)
 * [Requests](Requests)
 * [Responses](Responses)
 * [Activation](Activation)
 * [Monitoring](Monitoring)
