# Services Architecture


See the application architecture page for an overview of what a [service-oriented application architecture](./app_arch.html) does.
 The message-based services rely primarily on the Python Asyncio library. They are designed to be modular and extensible.
 Main categories of software components that manage the services:
 * [Metadata](./svc_metadata.html)* [Controllers](./svc_controllers.html)* [Topics](./svc_topics.html)* [Channels](./svc_channels.html)* [Brokers](./svc_brokers.html)* [Message Payloads](./svc_payload.html)* [Message Structure](./svc_structure.html)* [Clients](./svc_clients.html)* [Requests](./svc_request.html)* [Responses](./svc_response.html)* [Activation](./svc_activation.html)* [Monitoring](./svc_monitoring.html)
