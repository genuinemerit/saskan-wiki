# CONTRIBUTIONS

This is currently a private invitation-only project. That's because I am still learning so much and it is basically my hobby.

However, I do want to open it up to collaborators at some point, so trying to structure things to support community.

## COLLABORATION TOOLS

__Source code__:  [GitHub](https://github.com/genuinemerit)

- No team is set up yet
- There are 8 repositories, probably more over time, dealing with different levels of services.
- Collaborators would need to be granted access one or more of these repositories.
- It might make sense to move to a team Repo at that point.
- If looking for much broader feedback, then make the Repo(s) public.

__Issues__: For each repository, use the GitHub Issues tracker.

__Pull requests__: For each repository, use the GitHub Pull Requests feature.

__Project__: For kanban style task tracking, use [Trello](https://trello.com/ballofwax1/boards)

__Chat__: Presently, have Slack channel account named [ballofwax.slack.com](https://ballofwax.slack.com)

Collaborators would be invited to join these channels:

- #bow - for discussion on issues, pull requests, work tasks and design ideas
- #software - for tracking, monitoring servers and environments. For now this is only Digital Ocean
- #random -- for miscellaneous chat and fun
