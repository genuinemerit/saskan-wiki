## BowWiki app

Create a (Tornado) app to present and navigation these pages. This is for user guides and glossary pages. Not an actual wiki.

Keep focus on the User Guide / Glossary aspect. Use repo-level Wiki's for developer support matrials. 

Development reference pages collected here should move to appropriate repository-level wikis.
