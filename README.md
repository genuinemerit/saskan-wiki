# bow-wiki

In-game help, support, documentation

## BowWiki app

My intention is to create a (Tornado) app that supports presentation and navigation of these pages. That may not initially take the form of an actual wiki in that it is unlikely to include interactive editing or other feedback loops initially.

I am doing it this way so that my focus remains on the User Guide / In-Game Help aspects of it. In particular, I have an intention for a faily exhaustive Glossary that is text-rich and will link to graphic, sound, and maybe other types of resources as well as link to my BowLang services.  In other words, a bit of a world-builder, or at least the basis for one.

The Development reference pages collected here can probably just remain in GitHub. I am reluctant to move them into an actual wiki.  Maybe eventually if this were turn into an actual collective effort.
