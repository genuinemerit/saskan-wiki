# bow-wiki

In-game help, support, documentation

## BowWiki app

Create a (Tornado) app to present and navigate these pages. This is for user guides and glossary pages for the "Saskantinon" app. Not an actual wiki.

Keep focus here on the User Guide / Glossary aspect. Think of it as an in-game component. Use repo-level Wiki's for developer support matrials. 

Move development reference pages collected here to appropriate repository-level wikis.
